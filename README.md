# JavaCssInliner

Take an html template and css file and inline the css rules into style attributes.

This is mostly useful for sending emails.

This gem attempts to make the inlining process very performant. If you want a richer feature set and more usability please see [Roadie](https://github.com/Mange/roadie) or [PreMailer](http://premailer.dialect.ca/).

## Usage

Once I have some passing specs I will write some usability documentation
